# CET-MCA-S1-R_lab
This repository contains the programs I developed during my 1st semester in R language. The lab questions were divided into 2 cycles.

## Cycle-1

1. The file ’smoker.csv’ contains results of a survey conducted on 356 per-sons in a city.  Each record contains the ID of the person, smoking habit(current-current smoker, former-former smoker, never-never a smoker)and  his  economic  status(Low,middle,high).   Write  an  R  program  toread the data and construct a two-way table of smoking status versuseconomic status.  Also calculate the proportion of people belonging toeach category.  You may use the functiontable()to accomplish this.Write the output to a text file.
2. Simulate the outcome of tossing a fair die 10000 times and create theprobability  distribution  of  the  outcomes.   You  may  use  the  built-infunctionsample()to do the simulation.  Plot the probability functionand check whether the die is fair.
3. write an R program to find the sum of the firstnterms of the Fourier series.
4. File ’sales.txt’ contains data of price, discount factors and sales volume(number of units sold) of 3 items in three different Indian States.  Readthe data and compute the total sales bill of each item in each state.write the output with details in an output file
5. Simulate a random list of 1000 patients, each belonging to one of theage groups 40-45,45-0,50-55,50-55,55-60, and each having BP level oneof ”low”,”med”, or ”high” using the data prepare a table indicating thepercentage of people in each category.
6. The data file ”price.txt” contains the price (in Rs.)  of 3 items for 100consecutive days.  Read the data into a data frame.
7. Draw a scatter plot of month verses sales
8. lm()function
9. Construct a multiple regression mode

## Cycle-2

1. The file ’bulbs.dat’ contains life in years of a sample of 1000 bulbs ran-domly  chosen  from  a  total  of  100000  bulbs  produced  by  a  company.Find an approximate probability distribution of the life of bulbs pro-duced by the company.  Draw a density plot of the distribution.  Checkyour  model  with  a  quantile-quantile  plot.   What  percentage  of  bulbsproduced by the company will have life more than one year ?
2. The file pois.dat contains data of no.  of accidents in a city for 365 days.Fit  a  Poisson  distribution  and  calculate  the  theoretical  frequencies.Also  compare  the  theoretical  and  computed  frequencies  using  a  barplot.
3. Central limit theorem
4. If U1 and U2 are  two  independent  random  variables  uniformly  dis-tributed  between  0  and  1  find  the  density  function  of U1+U2 using simulation.
5. binomial distribution
